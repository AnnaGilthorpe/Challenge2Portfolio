      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I live in London in the UK. I have worked as a TV actress, singer/ songwriter, voiceover artist and teacher for the last 15 years. I am co-founder to two award winning businesses (<a href="https://www.thetootsierollers.com/">Tootsie Rollers</a> and <a href="https://www.musicaldots.co.uk/">Musical Dots</a>) in the entertainment and education sectors. I have always been incredibly interested in tech - my band members call me 'Techy Tootsie' - and love to learn new skills. Historically this has been me teaching myself on my laptop until recently I decided to take the plunge and fully immerse myself in a coding course. I am enjoying the challenge in a new industry and can't wait to collaborate with others and get creative.</p>
